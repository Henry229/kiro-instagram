# Project Rules

## IMPORTANT

- **ALWAYS use Shadcn MCP to create UI**
- **ALWAYS prioritize server components over client components**

## Testing and Quality Assurance

After completing any coding task, you MUST:

1. **Run Tests**: Use the 'test sprite' MCP to execute all relevant tests
2. **Code Review**: Review the changes for:
   - Code quality and readability
   - Best practices adherence
   - Potential bugs or edge cases
3. **Lint Check**: Run linting to ensure code style consistency
4. **Type Check**: Verify TypeScript types are correct and complete
5. **Git Commit**: Stage, commit, and push changes
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Ensure all changes are properly tracked
   - Push to remote repository

## Workflow

- Always complete the full testing cycle before marking a task as complete
- If any check fails, fix the issues and re-run all checks
- Document any test failures or issues found during the review process
- Never skip the git commit step - all work should be version controlled
